# Flixx Movie App

Flixx is a full-stack movie application built using Vanilla JS. It fetches data from the TMDB API, one of the best APIs for creating movie applications like Netflix, providing users with a platform to explore trending, upcoming, and popular movies and TV shows. The application includes search functionality with radio buttons for filtering by movie or TV show. Additionally, users can navigate to detailed pages for each movie or TV show, which display information about the title along with the top cast members and their TMBD profiles.
